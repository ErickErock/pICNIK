# pICNIK

A python package to caculate activation energy of thermally stimulated processes by means of integral isoconversional methods.

The repository consist in the following directories:
- pyace.py. Contains the package
- examples. Contains a script (example.py) which executes some commmands of pyace in order to ilustrate the suggested prcedure. And three more directories which contain data to use whith example.py:
    - Constant_E. Simulated TGA data for a process with constant activation energy.
    - Two_Steps. Simulated TGA data for a process with two steps, each with constant activation energy.
    - Variable_E. Simulated TGA data for a process with variable activation energy.
